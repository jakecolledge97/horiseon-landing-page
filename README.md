## Description

This landing page is a simple yet sleek design to demonstrate a professional application of HTML and CSS. It has a working header with links to important parts of the page, a section to show what the business provides to the consumer, benefits of using this business, and a footer that all works together in a repsonive way. 

This project shows my skills in understanding CSS and HTML, and helped me in understanding Semantic HTML elements rather than relying on div tags for everything.
